## How to configure Vue Storefront

**Layer A** integration is very simple.

By default Vue Storefront uses ES index named `vue_storefront_catalog`. Please apply the changes accordingly to:
- `vue-storefront` [config file](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront/tree/master/config) `local.json` to point to right index name,
- `vue-storefront-api` [config file](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront-api/tree/master/config) `local.json` to point to right index name.

Restart `vue-storefront` and `vue-storefront-api`. 
**Please note**: By default `vue-storefront` is using `vue-storefront-api` as a proxy to ElasticSearch. You might want to use the Elastic connection directly. In that case feel free to put the `http://localhost:9200` or whatever Elastic URL you have as a `elasticsearch.host` to `vue-storefront/config/local.json`.

The integration requires You to change the `config/local.json` to set the proper endpoints for [Dynamic API calls](Dynamic%20API%20specification.md).
